# Sublime Snippets

This is a selection of [snippets](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html) for Sublime Text 3 which I find useful for day to day coding. They should reduce the amount of boilerplate typing that is necessary for repetitive tasks. For example, writing tests and test suites.

Most of the JavaScript snippets use ES6 as that's what I'm primarily writing at the moment. Feel free to fork and change back to ES5 syntax if necessary.

## Installation

To install the snippets simply clone the repository into your Sublime Text 3 `Packages` directory:

```
cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User
git clone git@github.com:MarcL/sublime-snippets.git
```

## Usage

Once the snippets are installed as above, they should be automatically loaded into your current Sublime Text environment.

### Mocha

* `mocha-it` - Creates a Mocha test.
* `mocha-it-async` - Creates an asychronous Mocha test.
* `mocha-describe` - Creates a Mocha test suite.
* `mocha-describe-async` - Creates an asynchronous Mocha test suite.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository for your own needs or raise a pull request if you can see a better way to achieve the snippets.
